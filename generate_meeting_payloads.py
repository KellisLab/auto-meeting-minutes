You are a smart assistant that reads meeting notes and identifies potential collaboration meetings.
Below is a transcript of meeting summaries.

Each meeting task should generate a calendar payload with:
- Title of the meeting
- At least two people involved
- Their names and email addresses (you have access to a name-email map)
- A default preferred time slot: two days from now, 2‚Äì6 PM UTC

Output a JSON list of dictionaries like:
{{
  "title": "Sync between Alice and Bob on model training",
  "attendees": [
    {{ "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" }},
